    <p>I’m a student from India and want to learn data science. I think it will be beneficial for my
        thesis work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this
        course. I live only for my scholarship (2100 rupees or about $35 per month). In this
        circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the
        certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my
        monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course
        as I want to learn Data Science in English. I want to complete the Data Science Course: To get a good job in the career. This Course will boost my technical and communication skills as well by the end of this course. It will help perform better in carrying out data processing, big data analysis and
        give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the
        certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as
        I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion
        Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online
        courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.</p>
<p>It's really impossible for me to pay for this course. I want to take this course as I want to
    complete the Data Science Specialization on Coursera. I need financial aid because I am from
    India and my income cannot pay for this course. Now I do not have a job to pay for it. My
    father income cannot neither pay for it. I'm a student, I didn't start my career yet and I need the financial aid because I can't afford the courses without having a job.I  need to take this course to work and have money to increase my skill and help my father. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I
    have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken
    on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will
    an invaluable learning opportunity. I hope these reasons are enough I really thank you. So I
    need your help by giving me financial aid.</p>

    <p>The course will help me study data science that helps me work a freelance to earn money. I'll
        always participate in the discussion forums and help others with my knowledge. I will meet
        deadlines and will not hesitate to ask if there's something I don't understand The certificate
        would be a valuable thing for me because it'll help me get better job opportunities and start
        my career as fast as possible. It'll show that I'm a hard worker and self-learner also that I'm
        very active. I want to add to my CV in the future. Then I want to complete the data science
        Specialization on Coursera. I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. A verified
        certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I will share my
        information to help others to learn and work to earn money. I hope that you give me the
        chance. And finally, I really thank you.</p>
